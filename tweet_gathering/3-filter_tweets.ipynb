    "# Part 3 - Classifying Tweets as spam or ham\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "In this section we are filtering our tweets. To do so we are training a model that performs a classifcation.\n",
    "Details of the model are mentionned below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In order for the classifier to be efficient, we needed good labeled data. First we looked at the free sources data quality. For example : SPAM base on kaggle, SMS spam on UCI machine learning, etc... However, the results weren't good enough. In general, the quality of the free available data wasn't good and specific enough and thus, was leading to poor classification results.\n",
    "To improve our spam vs ham classifier we needed a solution that would be efficient enough.\n",
    "We found the solution to be hand labeling the tweets. It would be specific enough to lead to good classification results. But, this was a tedious process. Furthermore it we needed a sufficiently large enough database of hand labeled data. We found a remedy in designing an algorithm that would label this data for us. But how ? Since Twitter was already doing a quite good job of eliminating spam tweets, so there was no need for an extremly accurate algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Labeled data\n",
    "To do so, we first created a list of spam words. That would help in checking whether the tweet is a spam. Then we gathered tweets from various sectors. With that data, we developped an agorithm that goes through each tweets and sees if one spam words is in the tweets if yes, the tweet is classified as spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our algorithm isn't perfect, a more fined-grained list of spam words would lead to more efficiency but it does perfoms well enough for the purpose of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification\n",
    "Further below in this section we show how we train our Spam classifier on the labeled data we got from our previous algorithm. \n",
    "Then how we classify our freshly gathered clean tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll save our ham tweets in this file:\n",

    "## Supervised Tweets Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In Natural Lanugage processing (NLP) in order to classify text, we need a way to transform text into a form that the machine can understand and analyze it. We call it feature extractor. Then we need a way to tell the machine which are spam and which are ham, and the machine will find the way to separate them into two groups. This step is called classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our algorithm, we will use two features extractor, one will be for vectorizing the text into count of each words. These counts will help the machine understand the recurrence of certain words in a spam for example. Then we will apply a tfidf transformer which is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus, in our case the tweet. Example (\"Viagra\") will have more importance than (\"kicking\").\n",
    "\n",
    "We now perform the training of our classifier on training dataset of our good labeled data then we test it on the fresh tweets we gathered.\n",
    "For efficency and readibility purpose we use scikit-learn pipeline to train our classifier. More information available <a src=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html\"> **here**</a>. In our case it is used to apply subsequent models on a specific data. Since we are applying a *Count Vectorizer*, then a *tfidf Transformer* and finally a *Multinomial Naïve Bayes*\n",

    "To conclude, we sadly, can see that our algorithm isn't perfect. We realized the importance of good data. Machine learning algorithms only performs well when there is high quality in the data. Furthermore, we looked for freely available data and did not take any costly solution into account. To improve the accuracy of our algorithm one solution would be to better understand how a spam is structured and find characteristics that differentiate it to a ham. That could be done by adding additional requirements that a tweet should pass in order to be classified as ham. Such as for example **weird characters**, **smileys**, **SMS words**, **better filter for languages**, **etc...**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main concern would reside in the fact that we are more **interested** in elminating the **false negative** than we are in eliminating **false positive**. As example, that would matter more that a **spam is classified as ham** than the inverse. Our **false negative** ham would lead to a **bias** in our sentiment analysis. "
